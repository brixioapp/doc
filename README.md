[brix.io](https://brix.io) is a Bootstrap Builder to design, create and edit responsive websites and user interface. A cloud-based service for front-end developers, web developers and designers.

>Brix.io is an online visual editor. With the interface you can add bricks (components) to a web page: either by clicking on a brick in the left side panel and then clicking again in a designated area on the canvas or you can use the drag-and-drop method. The side panel shows all the components in groups. You can collapse one or more groups to get an overview of relevant bricks. Brix also contains a Favourite Bricks panel. Editing bricks can be done by clicking on a brick in the canvas panel. This will open the properties panel. You can also edit the code directly. At the bottom of the canvas you see HTML and CSS tabs. Clicking on a tab will open the code editor. If you want to edit an existing CSS file go to the File Manager panel and click on the file name. This will open it directly to the right. You can add the names of co-workers and clients to a project which will allow them to collaborate on a project or add comments to (each brick) of your design. Brix.io contains the Bootstrap components and allows you to work with LESS files to design a theme.
